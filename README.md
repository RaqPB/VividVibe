# VividVibe
A project focusing on the visual experience of music, using the classic vinyl and the modern wave to enhance the experience of listening to music.

## The project
Currently this project is in **Phase 0**, focusing on the core engine: handling audio files and playback using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5.

## Phase 0
Foundational stage.
- Basic HTML5 Audio implementation.
- Javascript audio control logic.
- Repository structure and setup.

## How it is working (Phase 0)
A simple player:
1. **Input:** The user uploads the audio file.
2. **Processing:** It is created a temporary 'Blob URL' using 'URL.createObjectURL()'.
3. **Output:** The URL is inserted into the '<audio>' tag's "src" and it immediate plays the audio file.

## Built with
* **HTML5** 
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* **CSS**(Future UI/UX)
* **Figma**(Future Prototyping & Design)
